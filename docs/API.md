# GrowStreams REST API Documentation

> **Base URL:** `https://growstreams-core-production.up.railway.app`

All amounts are in raw token units (12 decimals). `1 GROW = 1_000_000_000_000` units.

POST endpoints accept an optional `"mode": "payload"` field — when set, the API returns the SCALE-encoded payload for client-side wallet signing instead of executing server-side.

```json
{
  "name": "GrowStreams Token",
  "symbol": "GROW",

### Faucet

The faucet mints **1,000 GROW** per request with a 5-minute rate limit per address.

```bash
# Request GROW tokens from faucet

---

## Token Vault

The vault holds tokens in escrow for streaming. Users deposit GROW into the vault, which then allocates funds to active streams.

### Vault Config & Status

```bash
# Get vault configuration
curl https://growstreams-core-production.up.railway.app/api/vault/config

# Check if vault is paused
curl https://growstreams-core-production.up.railway.app/api/vault/paused
```

### Vault Balance

```bash
# Get vault balance for a specific owner + token pair
curl https://growstreams-core-production.up.railway.app/api/vault/balance/0xOWNER_HEX/0xGROW_TOKEN_ID

# Get stream allocation amount
curl https://growstreams-core-production.up.railway.app/api/vault/allocation/1
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "owner": "0x...",
  "token": "0x...",
  "total_deposited": "4000000000000",
  "total_allocated": "3601000000",
  "available": "3996399000000"
}
```

### Vault Deposit & Withdraw

```bash
# Deposit GROW tokens into vault (requires prior approve on GROW token)
curl -X POST https://growstreams-core-production.up.railway.app/api/vault/deposit \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "token": "0xGROW_TOKEN_ID",
    "amount": "4000000000000"
  }'

# Withdraw available (non-allocated) GROW from vault
curl -X POST https://growstreams-core-production.up.railway.app/api/vault/withdraw \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \

    "amount": "1000000000000"
  }'

- `token` — hex-encoded program ID of the token (GROW token ID)
- `flowRate` — tokens per second in raw units (e.g. `1000000` = 0.000001 GROW/sec)
- `initialDeposit` — must cover at least `flowRate * min_buffer_seconds` (default 3600s)
