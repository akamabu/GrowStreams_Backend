# GrowStreams V2 — Protocol Specification

## Overview

GrowStreams is a generalized money streaming protocol. A **stream** is a continuous, per-second transfer of fungible tokens from a sender to a receiver. Streams are fully on-chain, composable, and programmable.

---

## Core Concepts

### Stream

A stream is defined by:
- **Sender** — the account funding the stream
- **Receiver** — the account accruing tokens
- **Token** — the fungible token being streamed (e.g., USDC)
- **Flow Rate** — tokens per second (in smallest unit, e.g., micro-USDC)
- **Deposit** — total tokens deposited to fund the stream
- **Buffer** — remaining deposit available to sustain the stream

### Flow Rate Accounting

At any point in time `t`, the total amount streamed is:

```
total_streamed = settled_amount + (flow_rate × (t - last_update))
```

Where `settled_amount` is the cumulative tokens accounted for at `last_update`.

The **withdrawable balance** for the receiver is:

```
withdrawable = min(total_streamed, deposited) - withdrawn
```

The **remaining buffer** for the sender is:

```
remaining_buffer = deposited - total_streamed
```

### Solvency Model

Every active stream must maintain a minimum buffer:

```
min_buffer = flow_rate × min_buffer_seconds
```

If `remaining_buffer < min_buffer`, the stream becomes eligible for **liquidation** — any actor can call `Liquidate` to pause it, preventing the receiver from being owed tokens that don't exist.

This ensures:
- Receivers are always paid what they're owed (up to the deposit)
- No negative balances or uncollateralized promises
- Clear, predictable risk model for all parties

### Settlement

Settlement happens lazily — the `streamed` field is only updated when:
- The stream is updated (flow rate change)
- The stream is stopped or paused
- The receiver withdraws
- Liquidation is triggered

Between settlements, `total_streamed` is computed on-the-fly from the flow rate and elapsed time.

```

### States
- **Active** — tokens are flowing at `flow_rate` per second
- **Paused** — flow is halted; can be resumed by sender (or after topping up buffer)
- **Stopped** — permanently ended; remaining buffer returned to sender

### Actions
- **CreateStream** — sender starts a new stream with initial deposit
- **UpdateStream** — sender changes flow rate (settles accrual first)
- **PauseStream** — sender halts flow temporarily
- **ResumeStream** — sender resumes paused stream
- **StopStream** — sender permanently ends stream; refund issued
- **Deposit** — sender adds tokens to extend the stream
- **Withdraw** — receiver claims accrued tokens
- **Liquidate** — anyone can pause a stream below minimum buffer

---

## Token Vault

The TokenVault contract holds all deposited tokens in escrow:

- **Deposit** — tokens transferred from sender to vault
- **Allocate** — vault earmarks tokens for a specific stream
- **Release** — on stream stop, unstreamed tokens returned to sender's vault balance
- **Transfer** — on receiver withdraw, tokens sent from vault to receiver

The vault supports **emergency pause** (admin-only) to halt all operations in case of discovered vulnerabilities.

---

## Permissions

The PermissionManager allows senders to delegate stream management to third-party apps:

- **CreateStream** — app can create streams on behalf of sender
- **UpdateStream** — app can adjust flow rates
- **StopStream** — app can stop streams
- **DepositOnBehalf** — app can add deposits
- **FullAccess** — all of the above

Permissions can have expiration timestamps and are revocable at any time.

## Splits (V2+)

The SplitsRouter enables one-to-many distribution:

- A **SplitGroup** defines N recipients with weights
- When funds are distributed to a group, they are split proportionally
- Use cases: revenue sharing, team payouts, referral splits

---

## Supported Tokens

MVP launches with **USDC** on Vara. The architecture is token-agnostic — any fungible token program on Vara can be used by specifying its `ActorId`.

---

## Security Invariants

1. `withdrawn ≤ streamed ≤ deposited` at all times
2. Streams auto-pause when buffer drops below threshold
3. Only sender can create/update/stop; only receiver can withdraw
4. TokenVault holds all funds in escrow — no direct transfers between users
5. Emergency pause halts all vault operations
6. Permission delegations are explicit, scoped, and revocable
