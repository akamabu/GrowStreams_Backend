  - Right node: "R" (bob.vara) - Receiver
  - Connecting line with animated flow
  - Rate display: "USDC $8.48527/sec"

**NARRATION:**
> "Here's how it works. Alice wants to pay Bob. Instead of sending one lump sum, she creates a stream. She sets the flow rate - in this case, 8 dollars and 48 cents per second. The stream opens. And from that moment, value flows continuously. Bob can withdraw anytime. The stream keeps running until Alice stops it or the buffer runs out."

**ON SCREEN - Diagram Animation:**
```
[S] alice.vara ━━━━━━━━→ [R] bob.vara
              USDC $8.48527/sec
```

## 🎥 Production Notes

### Timing Breakdown
- **Section 1:** Hero/Home (0:45)
- **Section 2:** Protocol (0:45)
- **Section 3:** Use Cases (0:45)
- **Section 4:** Developers (0:30)
- **Section 5:** Ecosystem (0:15)
- **Total:** 3:00 minutes

### Navigation Style
**Two Options:**

**Option A: Smooth Scrolling (Recommended)**
- Start at top of homepage
- Scroll through each section naturally
- Feels like one continuous page
- More cinematic

**Option B: Nav Bar Clicking**
- Click "Protocol" → jump to section
- Click "Use Cases" → jump to section
- Click "Developers" → jump to section
- More explicit, shows navigation UX

**Recommendation:** Use Option A (smooth scroll) for main sections, but show nav bar clicks for specific CTAs like "Quickstart" or "GitHub"

### Visual Effects to Add

1. **Live Counter Animation**
   - Hero section balance should animate/increment
   - Shows it's truly "live"

2. **Flow Particles**
   - Animated dots/particles flowing from sender to receiver
   - Glowing trail effect
   - Speed matches flow rate conceptually

3. **Card Hover Effects**
   - Use case cards should have subtle glow/lift on hover
   - Shows interactivity

4. **Text Gradient Animation**
   - "endless possibilities" should have animated gradient
   - "ecosystem" should shimmer

5. **Button Pulse**
   - "Launch App" button should have subtle pulse/glow
   - Draws eye to primary CTA

### Screen Recording Setup

**Resolution:** 1920x1080 (Full HD)  
**Browser:** Chrome (cleanest rendering)  
**Zoom Level:** 100% (or 110% for better readability)  
**Window:** Full screen, hide bookmarks bar  
**Cursor:** Show cursor, slow movements  

### Mouse Movements

**Good practices:**
- Move cursor slowly and deliberately
- Pause cursor on key elements for 1-2 seconds
- Use cursor to "point" at important text
- Hover over buttons to show interactive states
- Don't move cursor erratically

### Highlighting Techniques

1. **Circle Overlays**
   - Draw attention to specific elements
   - Use sparingly (2-3 times max)

2. **Zoom-In Effect**
   - Zoom into specific sections
   - Great for code examples or detailed diagrams

3. **Spotlight/Vignette**
   - Darken everything except focused area
   - Useful for complex pages

4. **Animated Arrows**
   - Point to flow direction
   - Show relationships between elements

### Typography & Text Overlays

**When to add text overlays:**
- Emphasize key statistics
- Highlight feature names
- Show simplified explanations
- Add CTAs

**Style guide:**
- Font: Modern sans-serif (Inter, Poppins, or similar)
- Size: Large enough to read on mobile (48px+ for headlines)
- Color: Match brand (teal/green for primary, white for secondary)
- Animation: Fade in, not slide (less distracting)

### Voiceover Direction

**Tone:** Professional but approachable, confident, enthusiastic  
**Pace:** Medium (120-140 words per minute)  
**Energy:** High-medium, building excitement  
**Pronunciation:**
- "Vara" = VAH-rah
- "GrowStreams" = Grow-Streams (two distinct words)
- "USDC" = U-S-D-C (spell it out)

**Emphasis points:**
- "Per-second" (hero section)
- "Real-time" (multiple times)
- "Live now" (ecosystem section)
- "Composable" (protocol section)
- "10 minutes" (developer section)

### Music & Sound Design

**Music Track:**
- Style: Modern electronic, upbeat corporate
- Energy: Medium-high
- Mood: Innovative, forward-thinking
- BPM: 110-130
- No vocals

**Sound Effects (optional):**
- Subtle "whoosh" for page transitions
- Soft "tick" for counter incrementing
- Light "ping" for buttons appearing
- Flow "hum" for streaming animation

**Audio Mix:**
- Music: -18dB (background only)
- Voiceover: -3dB (clear and prominent)
- Sound effects: -12dB (subtle accents)
