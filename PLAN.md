| AI scoring IS the product | AI scoring is ONE APP that triggers streams |
| Achievement NFTs as primary output | Continuous token streams as primary output |
| Single-app mindset | Protocol + application layer mindset |
| Vara Network (Polkadot parachain) only | Vara Network + Vara.eth (Ethereum integration) |
| REST API for scores/badges | TypeScript SDK for stream operations |

## 2. V2 Product Requirements (MVP Scope)

### Must Have (Week 1)

1. **StreamCore contract** — create, update, stop a stream (sender → receiver, token, flowRate)
2. **TokenVault** — deposit/withdraw buffer, solvency checks, pause on buffer depletion
3. **Withdrawable balance** — receivers claim accrued tokens anytime
4. **USDC support** — first token; architecture supports adding more
5. **Event emission** — StreamCreated, StreamUpdated, StreamStopped, Withdrawn, Deposited
6. **Demo app** — web UI to create/manage/view streams
7. **V2 website** — at minimum: Home + Protocol + Use Cases pages
8. **README + docs** — enough for a developer to understand and integrate

### Should Have (Week 1-2)

9. **PermissionManager** — delegate stream management to apps
10. **BountyAdapter** — connect AI scoring to stream triggers
11. **Indexer** — real-time event processing for UI
12. **SDK v0.1** — TypeScript wrapper for core operations
13. **Developers page** — quickstart, code snippets, contract addresses
14. **Demo video** — 2-3 minute walkthrough

### Nice to Have (Week 2+)

15. **SplitsRouter** — weighted distribution to N recipients
16. **Distribution pools** — publisher → subscriber units (reward programs)
17. **Vara.eth deployment** — bridgeless Ethereum access
18. **Ecosystem/Partners page** — logos, integration CTA
19. **Advanced security** — formal invariant checks, threat model doc
20. **Additional tokens** — VARA, custom fungible tokens

---

## 3. Smart Contract Specifications

### 3.1 StreamCore

**State:**
```rust
struct Stream {
    id: StreamId,
    sender: ActorId,
    receiver: ActorId,
    token: ActorId,       // fungible token program ID
    flow_rate: u128,      // tokens per second (in smallest unit)
    start_time: u64,      // block timestamp when stream started
    last_update: u64,     // last time balances were settled
    deposited: u128,      // total deposited by sender
    withdrawn: u128,      // total withdrawn by receiver
    status: StreamStatus, // Active | Paused | Stopped
}

enum StreamStatus { Active, Paused, Stopped }
```

**Actions:**
```
CreateStream(receiver, token, flow_rate, initial_deposit) → StreamId
UpdateStream(stream_id, new_flow_rate) → ()
StopStream(stream_id) → ()
Withdraw(stream_id) → amount
Deposit(stream_id, amount) → ()
GetStream(stream_id) → Stream
GetWithdrawableBalance(stream_id) → u128
GetSenderStreams(sender) → Vec<StreamId>
GetReceiverStreams(receiver) → Vec<StreamId>
```

**Invariants:**
- `withdrawable_balance = flow_rate × (now - last_update) - withdrawn` (capped at deposited)
- Stream auto-pauses when `remaining_buffer < flow_rate × MIN_BUFFER_SECONDS`
- Only sender can update/stop; only receiver can withdraw
- Permissions can override sender restriction (via PermissionManager)

### 3.2 TokenVault

**Responsibilities:**
- Hold deposited tokens in escrow
- Track per-stream buffers
- Execute transfers on withdraw
- Emergency pause (admin-only)
- Liquidation: pause stream when buffer depleted

### 3.3 SplitsRouter (V2+)

**State:**
```rust
struct SplitGroup {
    id: GroupId,
    owner: ActorId,
    recipients: Vec<(ActorId, u32)>, // (address, weight)
    total_weight: u32,
}
```

**Actions:**
```
CreateSplitGroup(recipients, weights) → GroupId
UpdateSplitGroup(group_id, recipients, weights) → ()
DistributeToGroup(group_id, token, amount) → ()
```

### 3.4 IDL Design (StreamCore)

```idl
type Stream = struct {
  id: u64,
  sender: actor_id,
  receiver: actor_id,
  token: actor_id,
  flow_rate: u128,
  start_time: u64,
  last_update: u64,
  deposited: u128,
  withdrawn: u128,
  status: StreamStatus,
};

type StreamStatus = enum {
  Active,
  Paused,
  Stopped,
};

constructor {
  New : (admin: actor_id, min_buffer_seconds: u64);
};

service StreamService {
  CreateStream : (receiver: actor_id, token: actor_id, flow_rate: u128, initial_deposit: u128) -> result (u64, str);
  UpdateStream : (stream_id: u64, new_flow_rate: u128) -> result (null, str);
  StopStream : (stream_id: u64) -> result (null, str);
  Deposit : (stream_id: u64, amount: u128) -> result (null, str);
  Withdraw : (stream_id: u64) -> result (u128, str);

  query GetStream : (stream_id: u64) -> opt Stream;
  query GetWithdrawableBalance : (stream_id: u64) -> u128;
  query GetSenderStreams : (sender: actor_id) -> vec u64;
  query GetReceiverStreams : (receiver: actor_id) -> vec u64;
  query TotalStreams : () -> u64;
  query AdminAddress : () -> actor_id;

  events {
    StreamCreated: struct { id: u64, sender: actor_id, receiver: actor_id, token: actor_id, flow_rate: u128, start_time: u64 };
    StreamUpdated: struct { id: u64, old_flow_rate: u128, new_flow_rate: u128, updated_at: u64 };
    StreamStopped: struct { id: u64, stopped_at: u64, sender_refund: u128 };
    Withdrawn: struct { id: u64, receiver: actor_id, amount: u128, timestamp: u64 };
    Deposited: struct { id: u64, sender: actor_id, amount: u128, new_buffer: u128 };
    StreamLiquidated: struct { id: u64, liquidated_at: u64, reason: str };
  }
};
```

## 4. Frontend V2 — Information Architecture

### Pages

| # | Page | Purpose | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Home** | Hero + value prop + CTA (Build / Integrate / Try Demo) | P0 |
| 2 | **Protocol** | How streams work, diagrams, buffer/solvency model, supported tokens | P0 |
| 3 | **Use Cases** | Cards: bounties, payroll, subscriptions, revenue share, grants, API metering, gaming, donations | P0 |
| 4 | **Developers** | SDK quickstart, contract addresses, code examples, FAQs | P1 |
| 5 | **Ecosystem** | Partner logos, integration CTA, contact form | P2 |
| 6 | **Demo App** | Create/update/stop/withdraw streams, view history | P0 |

### UX Requirements

- **Per-second animations:** ticker counting up, flowing particle effects, balance counter
- **Buffer visualization:** clear gauge showing solvency status
- **"Integrate in 10 minutes" flow:** copy-pastable code, inline playground
- **Mobile-first responsive design**
- **Dark mode by default** (crypto-native aesthetic)

## 9. Risk Register

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Vara.eth testnet instability | High | Fall back to Vara Network (Polkadot) for initial deployment; migrate later |
| Solvency edge cases in StreamCore | Critical | Formal invariant testing; conservative buffer requirements; pause mechanisms |
| Low initial traction | Medium | Coordinate Vara amplification; lead with demo video; focus on developer experience |
| SDK breaking changes (Vara.eth API) | Medium | Pin API versions; abstract behind our own SDK layer |
| Scope creep (SplitsRouter in week 1) | Medium | Strict P0/P1 prioritization; SplitsRouter is designed but not built in week 1 |

## 11. Open Decisions

| Decision | Options | Recommendation | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Deploy target | Vara Network vs Vara.eth testnet | Vara Network (deployed, working) | ✅ Decided |
| SplitsRouter in MVP? | Include vs defer | Defer build, design interface now | ✅ Decided |
| Token for MVP | USDC only vs USDC + VARA | Token-agnostic (ActorId-based); USDC first | ✅ Decided |
| Frontend framework | Next.js 15 (match V1) vs fresh | Next.js 15 (consistency, reuse V1 components) | ✅ Decided |
| Deploy tooling | gcli vs @gear-js/api | @gear-js/api v0.44.2 (gcli fails to compile) | ✅ Decided |
| WASM artifacts | Raw cargo output vs gear-wasm-builder | `.opt.wasm` from gear-wasm-builder (required for Gear runtime) | ✅ Decided |
| Indexer tech | Custom Rust vs TypeScript vs SubQuery | TypeScript (faster to build); migrate to Rust if needed | ⏳ Pending |
